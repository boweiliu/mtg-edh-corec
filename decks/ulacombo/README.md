# Ulalek combo deck

Core ideas

1. Ulalek, Fused Atrocity - can copy the entire stack. Requires {C}{C} + an eldrazi spell.
2. This can easily go infinite if an ulalek trigger + something that generates {C} or {C}{C} is already in the stack, so we can loop and pay for the ulalek triggers.
3. Upside: combo is pretty resistant to standard counterplay; the commander only needs to be on the board for the win turn; and counterspells don't work on ulalek cast triggers.
4. Downside: takes a while, so have to run interaction, pillow-fort, durdle, or soft stax.
