Observed preferences for working with this user. Update as you learn more.

---

## Communication style

- **Direct, iterative questions.** User asked concise questions like "what skills do you have", followed by testing ("use the hello-world skill"), then probing deeper ("do you have subagents?").
- **Hands-on exploration preference.** User asked to "test them out" rather than just reading documentation about subagents.
- **Action-oriented.** User moved from understanding to testing: "try making a test agent and then i will restart you and we will see if that helps."

## Work style

- **Experiential learner.** User prefers trying things and seeing results over theoretical explanations.
- **Iterative approach.** Discovery → testing → documentation → next experiment.
- **Values documentation.** User requested "write a doc about this session" and "write your 4 files."

## Project preferences

- **Knowledge capture.** User uses nb tool systematically for learning artifacts.
- **Clean workspace.** User requested cleanup of test files after verification.
- **Template-driven.** User follows established templates for documentation (diary, worklog, etc.).

## Tool preferences

- **OpenCode TUI and CLI.** User is comfortable with both TUI interface and CLI commands.
- **Template systems.** Uses nb templates consistently.
- **Knowledge base.** Maintains institutional memory via nb tool.

## Anti-patterns

- **Over-explaining.** User's questions were concise, suggesting brevity preference.
- **Unverified claims.** User wanted to test claims ("test them out") rather than taking them at face value.
