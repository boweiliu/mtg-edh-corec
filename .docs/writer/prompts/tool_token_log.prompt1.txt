For the rest of this session, please track all tool calls (read/write, grepping, shell) and their token usage. Also track token consumption from planning, subagents, or processing user prompts.

Info to include: idx, tool/`plan`/`prompt`, purpose, args, results, tokens_tshirt_estimate, exit_code (only if applicable), duration in ms (only if applicable).

  For grepping, args might include the regex, the glob, and the path, '.' if searching in the cwd.
  Results might include the line range that was read, or the count of lines that were written. Or the size of any applied patches for editing.

Your agent id is X.n.m, so you should start by creating a file like .log/X.n.m/tool_token_log.txt.

Write to your logfile immediately and as you work. Make sure you include thinking, planning, or user-prompt blocks.
