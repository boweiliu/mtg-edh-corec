# mtg-edh-corec

Code and LLM workflow for generating a fun, synergy-filled edh deck.

Organization:

`/scryfall` - importing and working with scryfall + tags database
`/decks` - different decks we're building, for instance
`/decks/ulacombo` - commander = ulalek, do a CC colorless combo to win, lots of interaction until them
