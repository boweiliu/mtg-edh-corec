# mtg-edh-corec

Code and LLM pairing workflows for generating a fun, synergy-filled edh deck.

Stay in control of your deckcrafting while using LLMs to discover and rank suggestions.

Generate and run code to goldfish, track synergy stats, or help recommend what to fetch/what modes to select.

Organization:

`/scryfall` - importing and working with scryfall + tags database
`/rules` - importing and understanding the MTG rulebook and keywords.
`/decks` - different decks we're building, for instance
`/decks/ulacombo` - commander = ulalek, do a CC colorless combo to win, lots of interaction until them
