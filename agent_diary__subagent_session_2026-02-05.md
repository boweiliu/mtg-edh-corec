# Agent Diary: Session [current session]

**Agent:** Current session: glm-4.7 via opencode

## What happened
User requested investigation and testing of OpenCode's subagent system, including built-in agents and custom agent creation.

## How it went
Session was straightforward. Successfully tested built-in subagents (@explore and @general), discovered limitations of custom subagents, and created documentation.

## Observations
- User appears to be using OpenCode in TUI mode but also testing via CLI commands
- User is comfortable with agent systems and learning exploration
- User prefers hands-on experimentation over just reading docs

## Confusing or unexpected
- Initially expected custom subagents to work via Task tool, but they don't
- Task tool only accepts built-in agent types "general" and "explore"

## Learnings
- Custom subagents created via config work differently than built-in ones
- They can only be invoked via @mention in TUI, not Task tool
- Documentation is useful for bridging user understanding

## Open questions
- None at this time
